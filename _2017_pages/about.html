      <h1>Asynchronous activities</h1>

      <h2 class="first">Video presentations</h2>

      <p>The heart of PyMCon are its video presentations. The speakers have all prerecorded
      their presentations to be published on October 24th. PyMCon videos are available
      for everyone without any registration required.</p>

      <p>
      There are three presentation formats:
      <dl>
        <dt><a class="reference internal" href="./cfp#talks">Talks</a></dt>
        <dd>30-40 min video about tricks, best practices, related library, etc.</dd>
        <dt><a class="reference internal" href="./cfp#tutorials">Tutorials</a></dt>
        <dd>60 min video + engaging exercises diving into a topic.</dd>
        <dt><a class="reference internal" href="./cfp#lbam">Let's build a model</a></dt>
        <dd>45 min to 120 min video documenting how to build an example model using PyMC or associated library such as Bambi.</dd>
      </dl>

      <h2 class="first">Asynchronous discussion</h2>

      <p>In order to ease the interaction with the speakers and encourage discussion on the different talk topics, each talk has its own post on <a href="https://discourse.pymc.io/">PyMC Discourse</a>.</p>
      <p>PyMCon is an async first conference. Not being able to attend the live session on the 31st does not prevent accessing the talks nor interacting with the speakers.</p>

      <div class="centered">
         <a href ="https://discourse.pymc.io/c/pymcon/2020talks/15" class="btn btn-sm normal-text">Access the async discussion</a>

      <h2 class="first">Begginer zone</h2>

      <p>If you’re brand new to Bayesian statistics, have questions, but not sure where
      to start, the Beginner zone is the place. Specifically its a mailing list like chat
      channel in the PyMCon 2020 Zulip organization where seasoned Bayesians will be
      available to to help folks out.</p>

      <p>It’ll be active from October 24th to November 7th. If you’re interested please
      register using the form below and you’ll get an invite shortly.</p>

      </div>

      <h2 class="first">Discourse networking</h2>

      <p>Starting October 24th, PyMC Discourse is not only a place for PyMC related questions.
      Our sponsors and community partners will also have topics dedicated to them where
      attendees to PyMCon's async format can network and interact with them.</p>

      <div class="centered">

      their video presentations.</p>
      <h2 class="first">Sprint</h2>
      <p>PyMCon will also host a Sprint during the Africa/Asia/Europe time zone to encourage
      and guide new contributors to the different libraries of the PyMC project.</p>
      <p>The sprint will have core contributors dedicated to onboard the new contributors,
      point to interesting issues and make sure the PRs are reviewed.</p>

      <h1>Diversity and Inclusion at PyMCon</h1>

      <p>Our commitment to the PyMC community is to create an inclusive and
      respectful conference environment that invites participation of people from all
      backgrounds, including, but not limited to gender, age, ethnicity, religion,
      accessibility and sexual orientation.</p>

      <p>D&I touches every aspect of the conference, and we have various initiatives to
      promote diversity and inclusivity at PyMCon. Here are some examples at different
      levels:</p>

      <h2 class="first">PyMCon organization</h2>
      <p></p>
      <ul>
        <li>The <a href="./code_of_conduct">Code of Conduct</a> is strictly enforced.
        There are guidelines regarding code of conduct enforcement as well as an appeal
        process. We hope none of the two will be needed, but we are ready to ensure
        PyMCon is an inclusive and respectful environment.</li>
        <li>We are conducting outreach with <a href="./#communitypartner">community partners</a>
          to involve participants from all backgrounds.</li>
        <li>We are offering Diversity Scholarships</li>
        <li>We are offering a <a href="">Begginer Zone</a> for anyone new to the community
        to get aquainted with PyMC and get introduced to the community.</li>
        <li>We are working to make sure all the videos have captions. Contact us on
          Zulip if you want to help or if you'd like to also have translated captions</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="first">Attendees</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Share and participate in the various ways: ask questions, volunteer, attend,
          contribute to the sprint</li>
        <li>Share our information with affinity groups</li>
        <li>Contact us with any need we may have missed. You'll find us on Zulip ready
          to help</li>
        <li>Share suggestions with us. We have a
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0J7_1n8oSo1cpyCQK44YfX4BRIlPX4sHG58DqBuBcHS4UIQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">suggestion box</a>
          just for that</li>
        <li>Fill our <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdewdlbk6OrWrAyz_Qg5SwjD9ZzQOxsRacnRO7M7OY8QTaGGQ/viewform?usp=sf_link">PyMCon attendee survey</a>.
        It will help us better understand and dedicate our efforts where they are most needed.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="first">Everyone</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>Follow our <a href="./code_of_conduct">code of conduct</a> and communicate any issues</li>
        <li>Use inclusive language (<a href="https://www.recurse.com/social-rules">Inclusive language</a>,
          <a href="https://heyguys.cc/">Hey Guys</a>)</li>
        <li>PacMan Rule: include others in discussion, leave space open in circle for others to join.
        We believe Zulip's streams and topics provide a great platform for that by allowing
        everyone in a stream to receive the messages while keeping them together and opt out in topics.</li>
      </ul>
