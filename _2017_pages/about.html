      <h1>Asynchronous activities</h1>

      <h2 class="first">Video presentations</h2>

      <p>The heart of PyMCon are its video presentations. The speakers have all prerecorded
      their presentations to be published on October 24th. PyMCon videos are available
      for everyone without any registration required.</p>

      <p>
      There are three presentation formats:
      <dl>
        <dt><a class="reference internal" href="./cfp#talks">Talks</a></dt>
        <dd>30-40 min video about tricks, best practices, related library, etc.</dd>
        <dt><a class="reference internal" href="./cfp#tutorials">Tutorials</a></dt>
        <dd>60 min video + engaging exercises diving into a topic.</dd>
        <dt><a class="reference internal" href="./cfp#lbam">Let's build a model</a></dt>

      <h2 class="first">Asynchronous discussion</h2>

      <p>In order to ease the interaction with the speakers and encourage discussion on the different talk topics, each talk has its own post on <a href="https://discourse.pymc.io/">PyMC Discourse</a>.</p>
      <p>PyMCon is an async first conference. Not being able to attend the live session on the 31st does not prevent accessing the talks nor interacting with the speakers.</p>

      <div class="centered">
         <a href ="https://discourse.pymc.io/c/pymcon/2020talks/15" class="btn btn-sm normal-text">Access the async discussion</a>

      <h2 class="first">Begginer zone</h2>

      <p>If you’re brand new to Bayesian statistics, have questions, but not sure where
      to start, the Beginner zone is the place. Specifically its a mailing list like chat
      channel in the PyMCon 2020 Zulip organization where seasoned Bayesians will be
      available to to help folks out.</p>

      <p>It’ll be active from October 24th to November 7th. If you’re interested please
      register using the form below and you’ll get an invite shortly.</p>

      </div>

      <h2 class="first">Discourse networking</h2>

      <p>Starting October 24th, PyMC Discourse is not only a place for PyMC related questions.
      Our sponsors and community partners will also have topics dedicated to them where
      attendees to PyMCon's async format can network and interact with them.</p>
