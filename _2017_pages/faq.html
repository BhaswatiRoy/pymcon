      <h2 class="first">Where is the ticket revenue going?</h2>
      <p> We are incredibly proud to say that all revenue, excluding a small transaction,
        supports Scientific Open Source through funding NumFOCUS and the PyMC group of projects.
        It funds opportunities such as student development, developer summits, and things like
        like slack and logos which bring the project together.

      </p>

      <h2 class="first">Are the donations tax deductible?</h2>
      <p>
        In the United States the donation portion is tax deductible as NumFOCUS is a registered 501c3.
        If outside of the United States you'll need to check with your local tax locality.
